<h3>
A hippo in the Hand
</h3>

------------


<p>
  There I was. A lonely Kid lost in the local woods on a clammy hot day. The sun  roasted my sticky flesh as I threw myself to the ground. I could hear <i>HIM</i>  comming. I took a quick glance at the small hippopotamus that I was shielding in  my palm. It made a gleeful noise as it shot its head toward the light. I covered  him. I did not want to give away our position now. Not after all the work We've  done protecting him.

    All of a sudden there was a <b>CRUNCH</b>. I shot to my feet and started sprinting full force away from the rusted, frame hunting me. They were easy to see even in these woods. They lit up brightly from a few status lights still ticking away, but what really brought catches your eye is the Bright light hidden inside their head. Shining through their decayed featureless faces, like a torch through branches of a tree.

    I tripped in my haste, falling to the ground again. It was unintentional this time, so I looked down to check on the little hippo I had been protecting for so long. A deep feeling of dread washed through my chest, my face slinked off the bones in anguish. The little beast had become only a ball of sticky grey goo in my hands
